This project is from the Front End Mentor website. The goal was to create a simple webpage with an omlette recipe. The only parts that was completed was the text for the recipe.
* All elements had to be added to the HTML page
* All CSS styling needed to be completed.

I will continue to complete these challenges to sharpen my CSS and HTML skills.
